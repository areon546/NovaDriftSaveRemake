# NovaDriftSaveRemake
this is a tool that would be used to remake lost save files in the oh so popular game, Nova Drift

user guide: 
this wont exist until the project is in a publishable state

[plan](plan.md)

[main](main.py) creates a save.ini file that can be dragged to "%user%\AppData\Local\NovaDrift" where the Nova Drift (ND) save file is stored as 'save.ini'. When you create yours, it will replace the current one. 

Warning, do not download this into "Local\NovaDrift". It will have unintended consequences if something goes wrong.
