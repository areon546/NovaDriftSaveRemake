# NovaDriftSaveRemake
this is a tool that would be used to remake lost save files in the oh so popular game, Nova Drift

user guide: 
this wont exist until the project is in a publishable state

[plan](plan.md)

[main](main.py) creates a save.ini file that can be dragged to "%user%\AppData\Local\NovaDrift" where the Nova Drift (ND) save file is stored as 'save.ini'

Warning, do not download this into "Local\NovaDrift". It will have unintended consequences if something goes wrong.
